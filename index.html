        <section id="computer-functionality">
            <h2>How Does a Computer Function?</h2>
            <p>Understanding how a computer works starts with its essential components housed on the motherboard. The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, acts as the brain, processing information and executing commands. RAM, or Random Access Memory, serves as short-term memory, providing space for the computer to work on tasks in real-time. The hard drive, or long-term storage, stores data even when the computer is turned off.</p>
            <p>Desktop computers often feature expansion slots on the motherboard, allowing users to upgrade components such as graphics cards or network adapters. In contrast, laptops are typically more limited in upgradability due to their compact design. However, they compensate with built-in batteries, providing mobility and allowing usage in various locations.</p>

            <p>In summary, computer hardware comprises essential components like the CPU, RAM, and hard drive. The CPU acts as the brain, executing commands, while RAM provides short-term memory for real-time tasks. The hard drive stores data for long-term use. Desktops allow for component upgrades, while laptops prioritize mobility. Both systems cater to diverse user needs.</p>
